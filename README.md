# Lollipop
## A basic fantasy CPU library based off of an easily modifiable header-only library 
(includes custom assembler, disassembler, and executor)

The header library is located here for you to import: https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/Lollipop/blob/main/lollipop/lollipop.h
It currently contains a [default instruction set](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/Lollipop/blob/main/lollipop/lollipop.h#L72), which is used for some default CLI programs:
- An assembler (Can be compiled and run using build-assembler.sh)
- A disassembler (Can be compiled and run using build-disassembler.sh)
- An executor (Can be compiled and run using build-lollipop.sh)

The plan is to expand it to be more dynamic and include more instruction sets in the future, as well as write some example programs demonstrating this usage
